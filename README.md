# Test-MVC-APP

Hopefully I actually get somewhere with this app.

I want to create a MVC web app that I can use to advance my skills in web development.

Areas I would like to focus on:

Authentication
Authorization
Using Dapper as the ORM
Using CQRS pattern
Creating efficient SQL within reason
Finding a relevant JavaScript library to help with the UI and Implementing the UI using that library
Investigating Lightweight tools to help  with Visual Studio Development (Possibly get Resharper again)
Learn different relevant branching methods
Learn different relevant source controls

I know that I won't be able to hit all of these just while I'm on the bench but I do hope to continue this application even after 
I get sent to a new client.In this regard, any databases I create will have the SQL files uploaded to source control as well so 
that I may be able to pick this up from anywhere and continue this project.
